            '<p><u>Late blight</u>: <i>Phytophthora infestans</i> infects all aboveground plant parts and potato tubers and can be transmitted via seed, culls, volunteers, and weeds (i.e., nightshade). Foliar infections begin with watersoaking and progress quickly to cause tan/brown dead tissue. Brown cankers can girdle petioles and stems. White, downy sporulation is often visible, with high humidity, on undersides of leaves along lesion edges. Infected tomato fruits remain firm underneath mottled-looking brown areas. Infected tubers appear as brown decay on the surface and into the top Â¼-inch of tissue. Late blight disease advances quickly under conditions of high humidity (&ge;90%) and cool temperatures (50-70&deg;F). Prevention is critical for control. Eliminate culls and volunteer plants. Avoid prolonged wetness on leaves and canopy, use certified seed, and follow DSV accumulation values that prompt early, preventative fungicide applications. If disease is present, treat with appropriate fungicides on a 5-7 day spray interval.</p>' .

        Disease::EARLY_BLIGHT =>
            '<p><u>Early blight: The fungus Alternaria solani typically infects leaves in the lower canopy where airflow is limited, humidity is high, and leaf wetness is prolonged. As dark brown lesions enlarge, they develop concentric rings accompanied by a yellow halo around the dark spots. Entire leaves may become diseased and die with a potential for defoliation. Prevent disease by using resistant plant varieties, if possible. Avoid foliar moisture/humidity by increasing plant spacing. Destroy and remove infected plant material to avoid carryover of infested plant debris the following year, which is a source of inoculum. Use P-DAY disease forecasting system for initiating preventative fungicides.</p>',
